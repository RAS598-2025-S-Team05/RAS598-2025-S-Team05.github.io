The central research question is: How can we design an integrated system where the UR5 and TurtleBot work together to perform complex tasks such as object manipulation and navigation in dynamic environments? Specifically, the UR5 will pick and place objects at predefined locations, while the TurtleBot will autonomously navigate to these locations, verify the object's presence, and optionally pick it up. This project aims to optimize inter-robot communication, improve object detection accuracy, and ensure robust navigation in real-world scenarios. By leveraging ROS2's advanced features, such as MoveIt2 for motion planning and Nav2 for navigation, we aim to create a seamless collaboration between the two robots, paving the way for applications in industrial automation, logistics, and beyond.</p>","tags":["robotics","ROS2","UR5","TurtleBot"]},{"location":"#example-figure","title":"Example figure","text":"","tags":["robotics","ROS2","UR5","TurtleBot"]},{"location":"#sensor-integration","title":"Sensor Integration","text":"<p>Sensor data is critical for enabling the UR5 and TurtleBot to perform their tasks effectively. The UR5\u2019s RGB-D camera will be used for object detection, with the ur5_vision_node processing the camera feed using YOLO/OpenCV to detect objects and publish their positions to the /object_detected topic. The gripper sensors on the UR5 will provide feedback to ensure successful grasping and releasing of objects, which will be used in the ur5_pick_place_node to confirm task completion. On the TurtleBot, the LiDAR will be used for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and navigation, with the turtlebot_navigation_node subscribing to LiDAR data to create a map of the environment and plan paths. The TurtleBot\u2019s RGB-D camera will verify the presence of the object after the UR5 places it, with the turtlebot_vision_node processing the camera feed and publishing verification results to the /object_verified topic. ROS2 topics will facilitate communication between the UR5 and TurtleBot, ensuring seamless integration of sensor data.</p> <p>During testing, sensors will be used to validate the functionality of each component and ensure the system works as expected. In simulation (Gazebo), simulated sensor data, such as LiDAR and RGB-D camera feeds, will be used to test the UR5 and TurtleBot in a virtual environment. Mock object detection nodes will simulate object placement and verification. In hardware testing, the UR5\u2019s RGB-D camera and gripper sensors will be tested for accuracy and reliability, while the TurtleBot\u2019s LiDAR and RGB-D camera will be tested for navigation and object verification. Sensor data will be logged and analyzed to identify and fix issues. Integration testing will involve testing the communication between the UR5 and TurtleBot using real sensor data, such as the UR5 placing an object and the TurtleBot navigating to and verifying the object.</p> <p>In the final demonstration, sensors will play a crucial role in showcasing the system\u2019s capabilities. The UR5\u2019s RGB-D camera will detect an object in the environment, and the gripper will pick it up, with sensor feedback confirming successful grasping and placement. The TurtleBot\u2019s LiDAR will create a map of the environment and navigate to the object\u2019s location, while the RGB-D camera will verify the object\u2019s presence and confirm task completion. Real-time sensor data, such as object detection results and navigation status, will be displayed on a web-based UI, allowing the audience to see how the robots use sensor data to perform their tasks. If sensors detect an issue, such as an object not being found or a navigation failure, the system will handle it gracefully, with the TurtleBot reattempting navigation or signaling an error. This approach ensures that sensor data is effectively utilized throughout the project lifecycle, from development to final demonstration.</p>","tags":["robotics","ROS2","UR5","TurtleBot"]},{"location":"#interaction","title":"Interaction","text":"","tags":["robotics","ROS2","UR5","TurtleBot"]},{"location":"#influencing-robot-behavior","title":"Influencing Robot Behavior","text":"<p>We will influence the behavior of the UR5 and TurtleBot through a combination of pre-programmed tasks, real-time sensor feedback, and user interaction.

E.g.</p> <pre><code>require('mathjax').init({\n  loader: {load: ['input/tex', 'output/svg']}\n}).then((MathJax) =&gt; {\n  const svg = MathJax.tex2svg('\\\\frac{1}{x^2-1}', {display: true});\n  console.log(MathJax.startup.adaptor.outerHTML(svg));\n}).catch((err) =&gt; console.log(err.message));\n</code></pre> <p>Note: this technique is for node-based application only, not for browser applications.  This method sets up an alternative DOM implementation, which you don't need in the browser, and tells MathJax to use node's <code>require()</code> command to load external modules.  This setup will not work properly in the browser, even if you webpack it or bundle it in other ways.</p> <p>See the documentation and the MathJax Node Repository for more details.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#reducing-the-size-of-the-components-directory","title":"Reducing the Size of the Components Directory","text":"<p>Since the <code>es5</code> directory contains all the component files, so if you are only planning one use one configuration, you can reduce the size of the MathJax directory by removing unused components. For example, if you are using the <code>tex-chtml.js</code> component, then you can remove the <code>tex-mml-chtml.js</code>, <code>tex-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-mml-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-chtml-full.js</code>, and <code>tex-svg-full.js</code> configurations, which will save considerable space.  Indeed, you should be able to remove everything other than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>, and the <code>input/tex/extensions</code>, <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code>, <code>adaptors</code>, <code>a11y</code>, and <code>sre</code> directories.  If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove <code>adaptors</code> as well.</p> <p>If you are not using A11Y support (e.g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove <code>a11y</code> and <code>sre</code> as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the MathJax contextual menu in order to avoid MathJax trying to load them when they aren't there).</p> <p>If you are using SVG rather than CommonHTML output (e.g., <code>tex-svg.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), you can remove the <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code> directory.  If you are using MathML input rather than TeX (e.g., <code>mml-chtml.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), then you can remove <code>input/tex/extensions</code> as well.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#the-component-files-and-pull-requests","title":"The Component Files and Pull Requests","text":"<p>The <code>es5</code> directory is generated automatically from the contents of the MathJax source repository.
